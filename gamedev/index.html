							<p>A compilation of portraits created for various projects throughout the years, with some being commission work. These portraits all follow a 16-color indexed palette, and fit under a strict box called the “hackbox”; a 96 by 80 pixel box that isn’t a perfect square, with the edges being cut off to fit GBA hardware limitations. My main focus is on game art and animation that tries to remain as faithful as possible to the original style while also integrating my own unique style, while also using my programming knowledge to bypass some technical limitations in order to make these insertable for GBA software.</p>

											<strong>ETERNAL WINTER</strong> is a personal project built with a makefile. It is a ROM Hack of FE8 that aims to make a custom game using only the engine as a base, and features a completely custom campaign, with entirely custom assets that utilize a custom framework. Developed from the ground up, the framework is largely written in and extended in using ARM assembly, and includes C and Python, so in order to work with this framework, I've had to learn how to write ARM, and how to integrate my design vision with what the framework expects. For example, the framework has a few different stages that transform different parameters of the combat; and different stages have access to different kinds of information, so a challenge was balancing the amount of ASM calls with emulator performance.
										</p>
										<p>
											This project was initially created so I could practice my programming, art, and music skills, and later became a comprehensive exercise in game development. Throughout the dev process, I learned pixel art, animation, and programming such as ASM, C, and Python from scratch, as well as how to integrate these assets into the system architecture and optimize them so they render correctly in-game and fit within technical limitations. Levels are built through an internal scripting language as well as custom domain-specific tools, and utilize extensive low-level programming logic to push the limits of the GBA hardware.
										</p>
										<p>
											A major focus of my work has been on player agency—developing dynamic mechanics that utilize bitflag manipulation, action structs, and unit states, and creating my own intuitive UI elements, and modular interface enhancements, including stack indicators and toggle functions, to form a more fluid and engaging experience. Another focus was on ways to bypass or utilize the GBA’s hardware limitations; for example, the limit of playing 10 tracks, 8 sounds (at once) was bypassed through relocating RAM, up to a max of 16 tracks, 12 sounds without sacrificing performance. I also optimized internal OAM allocation to prevent memory overflow errors within the constraint of GBA hardware, ensuring smooth sprite rendering within the hardware’s constraints.

							<div id="ABOUTME">
								<p>Hi! I’m <strong>Michael</strong>, a developer, artist, writer, and composer in the Boston area with a passion for pushing the limits of hardware while keeping project restrictions and scope in mind. I specialize in low-level programming and system optimization, with experience in ARM assembly, C, and Python. Working within the constraints of the GBA hardware has been both a challenge and a rewarding technical exercise. I’ve also worked with Unity, as well as Lex Talionis, a PyGame-based engine that utilizes a bespoke query and eventing language. In addition, I also work with web development; specifically UI/UX with Figma, and implementation through HTML, JS, and CSS. Beyond programming, I also work on visual art, writing, and audio; I’ve also created many of the visual and audio assets for my projects, learning pixel art, animation, sound design, and music composition along the way. My design philosophy centers on player agency, interaction, and fluidity, leading me to develop custom UI enhancements, a focus on responsive UX, dynamic gameplay mechanics, and modular systems that make the game feel intuitive and responsive.
